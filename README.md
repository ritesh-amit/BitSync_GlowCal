# GlowCal

## Developer Students Club - Solution Challenge 2021

- With aim to address the challenges being faced by humanity, DSC Students were invited to propose solutions for one or more [Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs)](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc-solution-challenge/UN-goals)
- We selected the problem statement 2: [Zero Hunger](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/)
- It also aligns to the following goals as a helping hand:
> 1. [Reduced Inequalities](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/inequality/)
> 2. [Responsible Consumption and Production](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production)
> 3. [Climate Action](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change)

- We created a Flutter Application named GlowCal, to help people having extra food due to some reason(cooked excessive, got an invite to a party, have to rush to other city)

- The application has a very simple interface, is completely private(we do not share the user's personal information with anyone).
- This application allows the users to donate food to local NGOs, who will transport it to the needy persons.
- You need to select the amount of food and give remarks, if any, to the NGO that will be coming to take the delivery.
- The application will automatically detect your location and list the NGOs near you.
- You can select any NGO of your choice(affected by your previous experience or fame of NGOs).
- You can also have an in-app chat conversation with the person who will be coming up, if there is any change in plan, or they need to come delayed, or early.
- You'll get a prompt for your packet request and will get a message as soon as the NGO accepts/rejects it.
